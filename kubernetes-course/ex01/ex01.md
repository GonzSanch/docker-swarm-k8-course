# First Steps
Practice checking cluster inventory, getting data from the Kubernetes API, and running containers.

1. How many nodes does your cluster have ?
2. What kernel version and what container engine is each node running ?
3. List only the pods in the kube-system namespace
4. Explain the role of some of these pods.
5. If there are few or no pods in kube-system, why could be ?
6. Create a deployment using kubectl create that runs the image bretfisher/clock and name it ticktock.
7. Increase the number of pods running in that deployment to three
8. Use a selector to output only the last line of logs of each container

-- Solution --
```shell
# 1 
kubectl get no
# 2
kubectl get no -o json | jq "{name:.metadata.name} + .status.nodeInfo"
# 3
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
# 4
# coredns: Is a DNS server that manage and setted up as kubernetes cluster DNS
# etcd: Is the key-value database of kubernetes, where all cluster data is stored.
# kube-apiserver: Is the API REST that validates and configure the data of all api objects on kubernetes.
# kube-controller-manager: Is a daemon that manage the control loop for kubernetes.
# kube-proxy: Is the network proxy running on the node.
# kube-scheduler: Is the control plane that assign resources to the differents nodes.
#5
#All of pods mentioned in the previous exercise are part of the kubernetes core and are required to kubernetes works correctly
#6
kubectl create deployment ticktock --image=bretfisher/clock
#7
kubectl scale deploy/ticktock --replicas=3
#8
kubectl logs -l app=ticktock --tail 1 -f
```
