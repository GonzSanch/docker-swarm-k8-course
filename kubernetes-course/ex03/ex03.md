# Let's deploy another application called wordsmith

wordsmith has 3 components:
  - a web frontend bretfisher/wordsmith-web
  - an API backend bretfisher/wordsmith-words
  - a postgres DB bretfisher/wordsmith-db

These images have been built and pushed to Docker Hub

We want to deploy all 3 components on Kubernetes

Here's how the parts of this app communicate with each other:
  - The web frontend listens to port 80
  - The web frontend should be public (available on a high port from outside the cluster)
  - The web frontend connects to the API at the address http://words:8080
  - The API backend listens on port 8080
  - The API connects to the database with the connection string pgsql://db:5432
  - The database listens on port 5432

1. What deployment commands did you use to create the pods?
2. What service commands did you use to make the pods available on a friendly DNS name?
3. What if we needed to add more wordsmith-words API pods. What is the command to scale that deployment up to 5 pods?

-- Solution --
```shell
# 1
kubectl create deployment web --image=bretfisher/wordsmith-web
kubectl create deployment words --image=bretfisher/wordsmith-words
kubectl create deployment db --image=bretfisher/wordsmith-db
# 2
kubectl expose deployment web --type=NodePort --port 80
kubectl expose deployment words --port 8080
kubectl expose deployment db --port 5432
# 3
kubectl scale deployment words --replicas=5
```
