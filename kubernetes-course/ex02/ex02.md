# Deployments with Services

1. Create a deployment called littletomcat using tomcat image.
2. What command will help you get the IP address of that Tomcat server?
3. What steps would you take to ping it from another container? (use the shpod environment if necessary)
4. What command would delete the running pod inside that deployment?
5. What happends if we delete the pod that holds Tomcat, while the ping is running?
6. What command can give our Tomcat server a stable DNS name and IP address? (An address that doesn't change when something bad happens to the container)
7. What commands would you run to curl Tomcat with that DNS address? (Use the shpod environment if necessary)
8. If we delete the pod that holds Tomcat, does the IP address still work? How could we test that?

-- Solution --
```shell
# 1
kubectl create deployment littletomcat --image=tomcat
# 2
kubectl get pods -l app=littletomcat -o wide
# 3
kubectl apply -f https://k8smastery.com/shpod.yaml
kubectl attach -n shpod -ti shpod
# and inside shpod container execute
ping ${littletomcat IP}
# 4
kubectl delete pods -l app=littletomcat
# 5
#If we delete the pod that holds Tomcat, the ping process will fail, beacuse container will be in terminating state. Then deployment will launch another pod for keep alive the Tomcat server but will have a new IP address.
# 6
kubectl expose deployment littletomcat --port=8080
# 7
# using shpod like question 3
kubectl attach -n shpod -ti shpod
# run inside container
sudo apk add curl
curl http://littletomcat.default:8080
# 8
If we delete the pod, the scenario will be similar to question 5, but the new pod created will expose port and DNS of ClusterIP still works 
```
